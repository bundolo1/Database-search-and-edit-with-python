# Database-search-and-edit-with-python
Search, get automatic results and edit a simple database through a graphic interface. Everything is written in Python 3.9.

This project started as a task from a company I work for, but the task took a different form very early on. I wanted to finish it nontheless since for me, the idea was interesting and might be of some usefulness in the future as a model for some more complex projects. I hope you find many uses for this little script.
